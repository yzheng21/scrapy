Outstanding product AND company!,5,dpkeith,December/24/2014,Style:Trainer,否,Not only is the trainer great the company is amazing!! Bought one of these about 4-5 years ago and use it at least 3 times a week for 45 minutes each time. Not sure what it was but the unit got really noisy like something was loose. Was able to tighten the one nut and it worked for a while but then it got noisy again and tightening didn't work. Got on the site for support and described the problem and asked if there was a fix for it. I received a response later that day from Sam Keller. He asked me to record the sound the unit was making and send it to him. I did and he told me that something indeed was wrong. He gave me a RA number and address and asked me to send it to them. I boxed it up and sent it (not understanding he only wanted the resistance part not the whole thing). About 10 days later I received a brand new trainer - at NO CHARGE!! It works great and is super quiet. I can't say enough good things about the company and Sam - too bad more companies don't stand behind their products like this one.,133
This device does all of that and I'm very happy with it,4,Jeffrey Pedersen,March/20/2017,Style:Trainer,有,I wanted a solid well built machine that would provide a smooth road-like feel when pedaling and so I was willing to pay a bit more. This device does  all of that and I'm very happy with it. I did need the CycleOps skewer in order to mount my Specialized Pitch mountain bike to the Fluid2. No big deal at about $13 and an easy swap out. The bike mounted easily and firmly. I started spinning with the knobby wheels on my bike and it worked fine but there was a lot of whirring noise. Fine for outside but I decided to put smooth tires on and that noise is almost completely gone. My ONLY gripe is that maximum tension isn't extremely tough. I'm a novice spinner and so far the tension is fine when I'm pedaling in about 15th gear but if I get very strong and pedaling at 18th gear (my bike's max gear) becomes too easy-- what then? Also a side note: I've read that some people have noticed their street tires becoming shredded by this trainer. I have noticed my rear tire gets a little warm to the touch after spinning for several minutes and have also noticed a little residual rubber on the smooth surface of the flywheel. Haven't noticed any "shredding" but it's too soon to say since I've used it maybe a total of a few hours so far.,10
Great Company- worth shouting about,5,Charlene Hewlett,March/17/2015,Style:Trainer,否,This never happens I have a 3-4 year old fluid trainer It has some hours on it but nothing crazy. This year it started getting really noisy (grinding sound) and the resistance was not as strong as it had been. I sent an e-mail to Cyclops and got a reply from Saris (apparently the parent company) with the usual questions how old? did you register it for warranty? where did you buy it? to which I could only reply no and I do not remember. They said fine take the drive motor off (one bolt) and ship it to us and we will see what we can do. 5 days later I got and e-mail with a tracking number for the new motor unit they were sending me no questions asked. You do not find a lot of good companies like this any more so I am writing my first Public review ever. Oh yeah and it is a great trainer too.,98
Great trainer,5,Jesse,September/26/2017,Style:Trainer,有,Great trainer and easy to setup. Took about 10 minutes from out of the box to ready to use. Smooth and road like feel. Also very quiet at 76db around 80rpm. I had this trainer for a little over a week now and only put on a few miles because I still ride outdoors. But I'm looking forward to doing more indoor riding once the weather starts getting colder. What's also nice about the trainer is you can make your bike fit adjustments and video your riding position.,8
This is very easy to use,5,Love2Read,January/4/2018,Style:Trainer,有,This is very easy to use and I find the "lower" impact resistance good for my hips and knees.  The noise is a bit much but since we have a basement space it's easier for us.  The noise may create issues in a smaller space.Do not forget the stiff hard mat that goes under your wheel or use a hard floor.  That's still pushing it though.  Believe me I learned quickly that you can burn a hole in the carpet without that necessary piece.  :),3
Big fan of cyclEOps,5,Cp,November/8/2015,Style:Trainer,有,i have to admit I am a big fan of their products. This is a great trainer for some serious training. During the week it get hard to go out and do the miles. But this trainer allows me to put the hours in the saddle. Sturdy construction. They have fixed some of the issues with the mechanism to hold the bicycle. And it makes it a lot more easier to set up.,5
received this today mounting bracket for the resistance unit ...,1,Brandon,December/21/2017,Style:Trainer,有,received this today mounting bracket for the resistance unit was welded on crooked. Placed side load on my rear tire because of the misalignment. I would be afraid of damaging my bike frame/ rear wheel by using it as is. I am currently awaiting the processing of a replacement unit. Hopefully the replacement doesn't suffer from the same issue.,2
Missing 'included' pieces- replacement easy to request,4,Suk4n4,February/13/2017,Style:Trainer,有,Product- looks good. I have to believe so since it was delivered without all of the purchases material so I currently cannot use it. Bummer. Not sure if anyone else had this problem that two bolts and knob are missing. Disappointed.Update: I called Cycle Ops and explained my situation and they are mailing me the missing parts. No hassle just good customer service. Improvement!!,One
Works well.,4,Cheryl Gilbert,May/29/2016,Style:Trainer,有,The trainer works great...no problems.  It was a bit difficult to figure out how to put it together though.  I was able to find a youtube video that was much more helpful than the papers with the product.,2
Number one rated for a good reason!,5,Andrew Rich,February/28/2017,Style:Trainer,有,Number one rated for a good reason! Super easy to set up though you do need to replace your skewer with the one they provide. Instructions are simple to follow. Gives a great workout and then stows away out of sight.,One
Riding again,4,William May,February/3/2014,Style:Trainer,有,Not quite as much resistance as I would like but works well. Would buy again.  Worth the money.  Easy set up.,9
Has been working great for me,5,Stef,December/18/2017,Style:Trainer,有,Has been working great for me.  I use this for the local indoor rides and I use rollers at home.  Has enough resistance for me but a strong rider may find it has some limitations.,One

This is a great trainer. Easy to setup,5,Waldo,February/20/2018,Style:Trainer,有,This is a great trainer.  Easy to setup and a great way to get quality indoor rides during the winter.  Very portable too and folds down for easy storage.,0
Assembly Instructions Lacking,4,Todd F.,April/1/2017,Style:Trainer,有,It's sturdy and a good design but I found the assembly instructions half-assed. Of course I got it together but I'm handy and mechanically inclined. It's an excellent trainer but the company should provide an video link for those who need it.,One
Indoor fitness bike,4,Designer Girl,February/15/2017,Style:Trainer,有,Nice works for indoor cycling.  Not too much resistance and a bit noisy for an apartment.  But when you can't bike in the snow this is the way to go.,One
The thing I like the most is the smooth increase in load as ...,5,ejp,August/23/2017,Style:Trainer,有,I have an Electra Townie mounted on this trainer and I'm using it to to rehab a total knee replacement.  The thing I like the most is the smooth increase in load as your speed increases.  Easy straightforward setup.  Saris produces quality products.,One

Easy to assemble and hook up with bike,5,Bruce Urbon,January/29/2018,Style:Trainer,有,Easy to assemble and hook up with bike.  Smooth operating and quiet.  Love this trainer! (glad I ordered the mat too so I can use it confidently on my indoor floors),One

Great product!,5,g.b.,August/14/2017,Style:Trainer,有,This surpassed expectations. On a carpet with the mat... all I hear is my chain and even that is practically silent.  Well built compact and smooth. I'd recommend this  no hesitation.,One
Easy to assemble and quiet in use,5,bref,February/26/2015,Style:Trainer,有,It is everything it was advertised to be.  Easy to assemble and quiet in use.  I put my cyclometer on the back wheel and the computer on the crossbar beneath the seat and can clock my time speed etc.  So far simply shifting gears gives me enough resistance.  Happy to be able to watch video or TV to pass the time.  Definitely keeping me fit and sane this winter season!  Very happy so far.,One
Love this trainer,5,A Harrill,January/4/2016,Style:Trainer,有,Works like a dream and is very quiet. Replacement training skewers are also cheap and easy to find. I bought an extra for my husband's bike. The flywheel generates a bit of a breeze which helps keep me cool during a workout.,One
My 3 issues with the CycleOps Fluid2,2,Cruz,August/22/2017,Style:Trainer,有,I've been using the Fluid2 for 8 months and these are some of the issues that I've notice.1. The oil heats up and causes the resistance to change a lot through the workout.2. As the oil heats up so does the roller which causes your rear tire to melt. This can be overcome by buying a spare training wheel cassette and trainer tire.3. This is a user error - I wasn't careful when I first use the trainer so I loaded up my rear wheel and the aluminum skewer clamp scratch my rear drop out and derailleur really bad.,4
Five Stars,5,Jeri Jorgensen,January/2/2018,Style:Trainer,有,Great price and works very well.  Not as noisey as some reviews suggested.  Very pleased with this purchase.,One
Nice!,5,Pancoastp@Loves.to.read.Lots,February/17/2016,Style:Trainer,有,Works great pretty simple set-up and holding up to 20 miles/day on a consistent basis. Not wobbly at all and pretty quiet,0
Well made works well but a bit unsophisticated,4,Larry in Lafayette,December/3/2015,Style:Trainer,有,I'm glad I purchased a fluid-technology trainer: functionally the CycleOps is a good straightforward high-quality product. It works well and isn't too noisy in operation. I'm able to ramp up the exercise level quite smoothly by shifting to a higher-gear. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that it is not particularly refined. The mechanism to clamp to the skewer (a well-made more robust one included) appears very strong but the operation isn't particularly smooth. The unit to tire adjustment mechanism could be described just the same way. There is rather a feeling of crudeness (that may be overstating it perhaps "low volume almost hand-built construction" is better) throughout except for the "resistance unit" which is clearly more sophisticated in construction. Since that is the most important component that's quite appropriate. All in all the Fluid2 works and works well. I'd rather it was strong and unsophisticated than refined and fragile and it certainly is more the former than the latter. I'd get it again. Recommended.,One

I ordered what everyone rated as the best..,5,James J. Naughton Jr.,December/11/2016,Style:Trainer,有,I had the Blackburn and it broke after intense use....suddenly you have no trainer and you need one so I ordered what everyone rated as the best....and it is! I thought my previous workout were tough but this takes the cake or more precisely takes the cake right out of you but faster! It is not hard to assembled though. What is a little tricky is getting the bike into place but when you do get it it stays in place....take your time and don't give up....What you end up with is a very hard and fluid ride....you use the know to adjust to your preferred level and then you use the bike shifters to either raise or lower the degree of difficulty just like as if you were riding....but by the time you are ready to rough it out believe me this bike will give you a very very strong workout....and is deceptively effective at first then it's just really hard so you end up lowering the gears to make it easier....otherwise it's like climbing the French Alps....it's worth it it's well-built....you need some sort of block for the front tire to level yourself off....and a mat under the bike and trainer if only for neatness....I believe it is the best and will leave you thoroughly worked-out....it's made in America and made really well....fill out registration onlne and save the box....it is a lifetime warranty. And it looks awesome to and runs as quiet as can be and again very solid....I love it!,One
Good trainer for the hamster in you,4,Texas1,January/11/2015,Style:Trainer,有,This trainer works well for the intended use as an indoor substitute to riding outside. I've read some reviews that have questions asking about how quiet it is.....it isn't.  I have a fairly large 4 bedroom home and have this set up in an upper room for training. There is a definite drone noise when riding which I would equate to having your truck idling in the garage.  My wife can hear it throughout the house.  So for you apartment dwellers yes I have no doubt that your neighbor below would be annoyed and hear you riding your hamster wheel.  If you are on the bottom level then perhaps it wouldn't be an issue.My bike is set up with a Quarq crank power meter. When riding on the trainer the watts are definitely reading less than what I typically average on the road. Seems odd considering the Quarq measures output at the crank. Either way I've logged enough miles on the road to know what 150 200 250 350 watts feels like.  I've messed with the tension on the wheel (yellow knob) to see if having it loose or tight affects the watt reading. At the point of being so loose that the bike tire seems to sleep a bit against the trainer wheel at high torque on the crank the watts are still low vs what I know the road effort readout is. So you will have to figure out the wheel tension and watt reading difference when attempting to gauge your workout versus your road work. In general I feel like the watts are about 25-50w low in readout on the trainer vs the road. So with that in mind it is still possible to come up with some good interval training workout plans.  I can't comment on the wheel speed variations on the trainer vs road since my computer isn't set to read speed of the wheel only speed via GPS.Set up - I've owned a cycleops before(circa 2002 model) and there isn't much difference in set up. One review points out the "terrible" instructions....mine came with instructions which were adequate and I'd think anyone that had never set one up shouldn't have any problems.  There are plenty of videos on line as well if one found it challenging.Overall it's a good trainer. The tension at increasing speed effort is realistic vs the road. I'd recommend it.,6
Five Stars,5,JKH,December/30/2015,0,有,Arrived promptly and set up in 5 minutes. The new axel holding method is an improvement,0
Great trainer.... once the fluid warms up...,3,jordan thompson,December/24/2015,Style:Trainer,有,My issue with this thing is the time it takes the fluid to heat up.  When its cold (you havent ridden it for 24 hours or so) the fluid chills down and doesn't provide much resistance.  Sometimes in the winter it can literally take 40 minutes for the fluid to heat up and provide some real resistance.  This is a real downfall for anyone using Zwift or an equivalent training program and I cant imagine what it would be like when you're warming up for a race in New England in late march or early april when its around 30 degrees.  I wish they'd fix this... it is very smooth and quiet and once the resistance picks up this thing is very good for sure.,7

Very happy,5,Crista McCord,September/30/2017,Style:Trainer,有,Now that I no longer live in So Cal I have to switch to indoor riding during the winter.  My last trainer was a wind trainer I purchase in 1984 so this is is a definite improvement.  I am using this with my 1984 Peugeot Competition.  I needed add a 1/2" spacer to the adjustment screw to ensure the friction wheel applied enough pressure to rear tire (I suspect my vintage bike has a shorter wheel base than current cycles).  I've found the fluid material provides a good simulation of road friction - running up and down the gears - I am able maintain a cadence similar to my road training. The base is stable and maintains position throughout my training session.  I do notice I am loosing quite a bit of tire tread.  I am very happy with this trainer I notice a some wine of the wheel but it is not bothersome.,One
Meets all expectations,5,Nathan Gaither,December/19/2017,Style:Trainer,有,Great trainer. This is my first bike trainer so I have nothing to compare it to but meets or exceeds all of my expectations. Both trainer and bike setup are quick and painless. The trainer folds up nicely to place out of the way and takes about 10 seconds to unfold and lock in the bike. Generates some noise but nothing excessive. Happy with the resistance provided. Ordered an additional axle for my wife's bike will very likely order another trainer to match so that we can have both bikes set up without fuss or muss.,One

and it's pretty much met all my expectations,5,CoolHandLu,October/12/2015,Style:Trainer,有,I've had this 2 weeks now and it's pretty much met all my expectations.  This thing's built like a tank VERY solid.  Yet it collapses into a surprisingly compact store-able size.  This is my first trainer so I can't compare it (noise-wise) to others.  I am going to assume that the wind resistance/blade/propeller designs are god-awful noisy because this thing isn't exactly quiet.  I had to turn up my TV fairly loud to clearly hear conversation when I'm hammering away in the saddle but this isn't a complaint just an observation.  I'd describe the sound as a loud hum.  The only real criticism I have are in the instructions in putting this thing together; they leave a lot to be desired.  But looking at the photos online and a YouTube video or two and I was good to go.  Excellent product.,One

Working But seemed used.,3,Amazon Customer,January/4/2018,Style:Trainer,有,Works good no problem setting up. No parts were missing.The reason I gave it 3 stars is because when I opened the product it seemed as if the base had been used before. There are marks on the inside of the trainer as if something scraped against it.,2
Need help on this one,3,T,February/11/2016,Style:Trainer,有,I have had this tire a few weeks now and it is destroying my tires. After two uses with a trainer tire there is a visible band of wear melted into the trainer tire (also by CycleOps.)Am I doing something wrong? The tire is inflated the resistance wheel is set to just be touching the tire.Also is there a way to lock the resistance wheel? it seems to weaken as I ride.,2

Realistic road feel  top notch customer service.,5,JC,March/9/2016,Style:Trainer,有,Excellent customer service.  My bike reflector made a buzzing sound that I misdiagnosed as a trainer noise issue.  Saris the company that produces the trainer replaced the trainer hydraulic unit quickly and free of charge including shipping.  The trainer is top quality and provides a realistic road experience.  I use it with ZWIFT and have been very satisfied.  I would buy again from Saris without hesitation.,0
Good trainer quiet enough for indoors,4,Junebug Jones,November/10/2015,Style:Trainer,有,I needed a bicycle trainer that would be quiet enough that I could train while watching Netflix on my laptop. Ends up that most of the time I just use the built-in speaker on my Mac laptop which I'm fine with: I turn the subtitles on to help a bit and the units is quiet enough I can still hear fine.  If I had the trainer set up where I could plug into my regular sound system it would be totally fine without subtitles. The unit's fairly compact (my house is small so that's a help). It's easy to pop the bike into and out of the trainer. The resulting workout switching between gears is pretty good. I got this to help keep me in shape for bike commuting 2 days per week x 16 miles. Definitely is doing the job. Only drags were the written instructions that came with the unit were worthless (Watch a Youtube video instead). And the unit wobbles a little. I haven't been able to figure out how to level it but I'm confident I can MacGyver something. Had to request a replacement part and customer service was really fast responsive and helpful.,One
Simple and Smooth good quality product and customer service,5,Marc Boutillette,January/6/2015,Style:Trainer,有,Purchased 4 months ago and have given it moderate use.  It went together easily and rides smooth and stable.  You do need something to lift the front wheel up a bit to keep it even.  I had an issue with the tension knob breaking this past week I called customer support and they shipped me out a new one with no hassle - great customer service and they stand by their product.,0
Great Workout (see update),3,BillW501,April/21/2014,Style:Trainer,否,With my old magnetic trainer it took me quite awhile to get my heart rate up and I could grind at 80 rpm in high gear for over an hour at 25 mph+ and my heart rate would barely go over zone 2.  With the Fluid2 I feel a training effect right away and can get no where near highest gear if I want to stay at 80 rpm for any amount of time.  I have no problem getting whatever heart rate I want to train at.  A fellow cyclist and friend told me "that's too much trainer for you".  Well - good.  I love the fact that I can't max this out right away.This is a solid unit and the noise level is less than the sound my chain makes.As for a comparison to being on the road - I feel like the trainer is actually harder than riding on the road.  This is fine with me.  I believe this will pay off on my road trips.Update 3 June 2015 - I originally rated this 5 stars but after a little over a year I discovered the resistance unit was leaking fluid so I called customer service.  They gave me an RA number and told me to send the resistance unit to them.  I had read other reviews where the company provided a FEDEX shipping label at no cost but I was not offered this.  They received the unit on a Wednesday and I had a replacement on Saturday of the same week.  Pretty fast!  I installed the resistance unit started a workout and immediately noticed a low rumbling nose and vibration that I had never experienced from the original unit.  After a few minutes and shifting into a harder gear for more resistance the noise changed to a high-pitched noise - sort of like you would hear from a table saw but of course not as loud.  I called customer service to let them know my problem but instead of taking my word they insisted I take it to my local bike shop.  I did and the LBS verified the noise and called customer service on my behalf.  Currently I am waiting on the second replacement.  I will update again after I receive the replacement resistance unit.Update 5 Jun 2015 - My local bike shop received the replacement resistance unit.  Again fast shipping.  They called customer service at around 12:00 on Monday and had the replacement by Wednesday.  They installed the unit for me and we tested it at the bike shop.  All was well.  I took it home and did a light workout.  So far no issues with the replacement unit.  If things change I will update.,102
But when it's too cold to comfortably ride outside,5,nikomiko,July/28/2015,Style:Trainer,有,It doesn't really compare to biking outdoors where it's natural to push yourself. But when it's too cold to comfortably ride outside this is great. I've ridden in Philadelphia winters with cold winds. This is great when you want to get some biking in when you can't face the weather.,One

Great trainer,5,Reagan K. Barry,January/29/2016,Style:Trainer,有,It's a CycleOps and it's works like a charm.  Can't go wrong with these.  Yes they can make some noise the harder you train but no one should expect silence when you are pushing wattage.  It's unrealistic.  Very smooth ride and doesn't get too hot.  Keep your legs in shape in the off season.,One

Not much resistance,3,Alex Griffis,December/28/2015,Style:Trainer,有,The description claims that you can up your resistance by pedaling faster but that's not really the case. The resistance hardly increases. The trainer is fine if you want to go high cadence and low resistance all the time but serious cyclists need more variance than that.,2

Great Purchase,4,Blaze,April/10/2014,Style:Trainer,有,I bought this for my husband who has loved his new sport...road biking.  Winter in Maine is tough and I thought this would be a great product for him.  It hasn't disappointed.  It is very quite and you can adjust the tension to your needs.  He is now on the road and uses the trainer less but I have been using it daily (still to cold for me to road bike).,2
Good off season training,4,Thomas G. Smith,February/15/2015,Style:Trainer,有,the only complaint is that I had to swap out the back axle lock to the one that fits the bike trainer. Otherwise solid stable quiet and easy to use.,One
Works great but instructions could be improved!,4,Shar,December/31/2016,Style:Trainer,有,Works great and not noisy! My only complaint would be the instructions regarding steps to attach and lock the bike into the unit were not clear and the locking mechanism was so tight I felt like I was doing something wrong and could damage the bike frame. It would be nice if the cycleops site had a video or more information on this part.  Other Youtube videos helped and I finally figured it out hours and a sore hand later.,One
A really great trainer- it is quiet enough that my cats hardly ...,5,HDWatson,March/29/2015,Style:Trainer,有,A really great trainer- it is quiet enough that my cats hardly give notice when I'm using it and I find the adjustment great for mimicking my street ride.  I do wish it came with a front wheel block- as I had to wait for a separate delivery of what was needed to make it truly stable.,0
Good trainer good customer support poor written set-up instructions,4,Outdoor Enthusiast White Mts NH,November/10/2015,Style:Trainer,有,Quick delivery easy unpacking. That is where the initial good reactions stop -- set up instructions were whoa-fully poor - they missed two critical steps which cost me two calls to customer service during cocktail hour. Luckily those folks were very accessible and helpful. Problem solved quickly with no further pain. Product quality seems fine - I just have a hour peddling on the unit. Use of the skewer (provided) is a must if you have a nice bike btw.,0
Rear skewer mount not compatible with any of our bikes. No adapter to be found.,2,Buffalo Spicer,January/18/2016,Style:Trainer,有,If you own a fleet of normal bikes like me and my family be aware they cannot be mounted on this trainer.  It requires one of those quick release things on the rear.  I have not been able to find an adapter.  It's possible this trainer is great.  I wouldn't know because I need to buy a new bike to use it.,3
Love this trainer and the folks at Cycleops,5,Zach K.,April/8/2017,Style:Trainer,否,I've been training indoors on a second-hand Cycleops adjustable mag trainer for years.  When it was finally time to upgrade I choose the Fluid2 as my next trainer.  Having spent this winter on the Fluid2 I can say without hesitation that I love this trainer.  Compared with the magnetic version this trainer is whisper quiet and the resistance is so much more progressive.  When riding my magnetic trainer I found that the harder/faster I pedaled the lower the relative resistance became.  As a result I found I could out-spin the magnetic trainer and not get the resistance I needed when doing intervals.  Not so with the Fluid2.  When interval training on the Fluid2 the resistance increases in response to effort.  This is exactly what you want when doing high-intensity intervals completely changing the nature of my indoor training sessions.In addition to loving this trainer it is worth mentioning what a terrific company Cycleops is.  When I had trouble years ago setting up the adjustment lever on my magnetic trainer the folks at Cycleops were friendly quick to help and completely unconcerned that it was a used trainer.  They wanted to make sure I was happy with their product regardless of its history.  Since then I've had occasion to work with Cycleops as they've supported a high school cycling club that I run and they have been wonderful to work with.  They support their customers like a small "family owned" company...a rarity in today's world.,One
Quality control leaves much to be desired,1,Emp900,May/7/2015,Style:Trainer,有,Item has a severely misaligned back bar - appears to have been welded on at a very uneven angle causing the unit to wobble to quite a degree. Very poor quality control. Will now have to wait another week as my refund clears item is re-ordered and I wait for a second shipment as I was told it would be "illegal" for them to simply send a replacement unit without having to do a refund and reorder first.How this slipped by CycleOps quality control is somewhat baffling and definitely has me second guessing even attempting to order a 2nd unit. Unhappy with at least a week delay as well as the need to take a cab over to the UPS to drop off the defective unit. At least the Amazon customer service rep I spoke to was friendly she gets five stars.,6
much better than average,4,John S.,February/12/2016,Style:Trainer,有,This is a good solid unit. Assembly was easy and mounting it to the back of my Trek 7300 went pretty well. There are a few gaps in the instructions. So knowing a bit about how your bike is put together helps. Operationally this unit works pretty well.  If you are looking for a great basic excersiser that will get you through the winter duldrums and let you hear the TV at the the same time this is for you. I would like to have just a bit more workout resistance and it's not all that quiet. But I don't think you'd be disappointed with the product. If you have a chance to trial one in the store that will help you really decide of it's right for you. I'd buy this one again.,6
I love this trainer,5,Amazon Customer,April/8/2017,Style:Trainer,有,I love this trainer. A few months ago I took stock of where I was heading physically and did not like what I saw.  Pulled out my Trek 720 hybrid. I like to ride but it's not always a practical thing to be doing when you live in Northern Maine. This trainer is very easy to set up and use. No need to read the instructions really. Spoke to a friend of mine about setting it up. She said and was right to not use the included skewer. My bike locked right in with no issues at all. Having to get off of the bike to adjust the resistance is not that big of a deal. This thing is also quiet. Mechanical things make noise and this one does also. when riding I have no problem hearing my cell phone thats mounted on the bike. i typically ride 4 times a week for about an hour each time. Some weeks I ride on more days. It might not seem like much to many riders but for me it's awesome. This trainer allows me to push myself and yet enjoy exercising at the same time. For this price it's definitely a bargain. Thank you.,4
easy to use,5,Trehx,April/6/2017,Style:Trainer,否,i have had this trainer for over 4 years now.  I havee used it to train for three Ironmen and 4 1/2 Ironmen.  It is very reliable easy to use easily put bike on and off and has been extremely reliable.  I often ride on the trainer for 3+ hours and it never fails.  I would stronly recommend the Cycleops Fluid2 for both experienced and new riders.  If your looking for a great product at a great price shop no further.  Big Big fan!!,2
Nice But Has Some Cons Too,4,M,January/25/2017,Style:Trainer,否,+ Very smooth resistance+ Sturdy construction+ Low noise+ Easy bike clip-in- Axle length adjustment falls into biggest hole if bike is raised up and then lowered- Max resistance is enough while seated but not enough for training out of saddle pedaling- Back wheel is much lower than front wheel when supplied raiser block is used (and many others)- Paint finish could be better- Gets really hot so may be a problem if you've kids and pets,2
Great trainer,5,Medicguy,April/8/2015,Style:Trainer,有,This has been a great purchase.  We were looking for a nice trainer that would be quick and easy to use. The fluid2 feels just like the road and it's the quietest trainer I've ever heard. It has a progressive feel when you ride and gives the right amount of resistance in any gear.  It was really easy to setup and the instructions were easy to follow. We have ours on a concrete basement floor and it's very sturdy when riding.  I don't know how much putting it on carpet would effect it.  The setup comes with a skewer that can be used on the road as well as the trainer.  I recommend buying a riser block for the front wheel though.  The only negative is the price but I think it's worth the extra money.  I highly recommend it.,4
Great basic fluid trainer,5,Robert J. Mrozek,April/5/2017,Style:Trainer,否,Bought in 2010 for training through the frigid MN winters. In early 2013 I noticed the resistance started to fade and a squeak began emanating from the roller area. Called CycleOps customer service and was told to send the resistance unit in for repair and received a new unit within the week. Great product and best customer service in business.,One
Bad Unit,2,J. Myers,February/1/2016,Style:Trainer,否,The unit arrived and I noticed some of the boxes inside looked to have been opened and retaped.  So I suspect it had been returned red flag.  When I put the unit together the yellow knob (the clutch) would not pull the unit tight up against the tire it was striped.  I left a message on the factory phone listed in the instructions.  The woman was very nice and said they would send me new parts.  However she said it would take a week and they would not overnight it to me.  So I can get a whole new unit via Prime in two days but it takes a week to get a couple of small parts....  Maybe I should just order an entire new unit and return the defective one.  I asked the rep if that part was a weakness in their product and she hesitated and carefully said "it happens and it is something that gets used a lot and will wear but we sell new ones."  I am wondering if I bought the wrong brand?,3
Well made,5,Marcene Mitchell,September/12/2017,Style:Trainer,有,It's doing great and there is not a lot of noice.,One
For a full size bike works great...,3,Ohioan,February/12/2016,Style:Trainer,有,Works nicely for my full size bike.  It requires an additional adapter however to handle 22" wheels.  And the adapter is not a quick on and off.  I've had this unit for a while now so am keeping but am looking into a similar unit of a different brand that handles different wheel sizes from the get go. But that's more money I'd rather not have had to spend.For a full size bike works great.,3
Easy to set up with smooth resistance,5,Dixie Brillhart,January/19/2017,Style:Trainer,有,This was exactly what I was expecting it to be.  Easy to set up with  smooth resistance all in a very stable platform.  I really enjoy the ability to stay in condition indoors when the outdoor conditions are prohibitive.,2
Great product but would be even better with a way to adjust it from the bike.,4,Pete F,January/26/2016,Style:Trainer,有,I researched several review sites and this was listed as the best value.  I have to agree It is like riding on the road.  The only remotely negative comment I have is that if this is quiet I would hate to hear the other trainers.  There is a hum for all to hear.,5
... a little noisier than when we tested one just like it at the bike shop,4,Dennis L. Weaver,August/24/2016,Style:Trainer,有,No issues yet except a little noisier than when we tested one just like it at the bike shop.  But is works.,3
Great trainer. Best one in it's class.,5,TravelingDentist,April/8/2017,Style:Trainer,否,I love the trainer.Super stable.Very easy to setup. The large yellow knob will click once the wheel the tension is correct.The flywheel keeps the trainer running really smooth.It is also very quiet. If you're looking for a trainer then this should be at the top of the list.,0
You won't regret it,5,Amazon Customer,April/4/2017,Style:Trainer,否,I bought my Fluid 2 trainer 4-5 months ago and I've never had any regrets. I love it. I use it almost daily for all kinds of workouts. Sprint intervals tempo rides and cool downs. Anything in between. It is the best when it rains and you have no other option. Or if you want to catch up on some TV shows. Knock out two birds with one stone. They sell everything you need.. one stop shop. They are willing and ready to assist. You can't go wrong. 10/10 would recommend.,0
Fantastic indoor ride,5,Tim K,April/5/2017,Style:Trainer,否,I've been using this trainer for a while now. Gives me a great workout.  I am very happy with it it is pretty quiet with my road bike. There is great customer service with this company.  I couldn't be happier with this trainer.  Very easy to get your bike in and out of this trainer was one thing that drove me to this trainer. Their virtual trainer is pretty cool.,0

Durable and Easy to Use,5,E. Arentsen,June/14/2016,Style:Trainer,否,Exceptionally functional and easy to use.  I've had mine for a couple of years and have put more than 100 hours on it and it's held up wonderfully.  I typically use it when time or weather make riding on the road impractical or as a warm up tool prior to a race.  Mounting a bike is very quick and easy and I do not hesitate to swap bikes out of the trainer.  Resistance is controlled at a fairly gross level by shifting gears and changing cadence.  The trainer can handle sprints over 800 watts and sustained effort over 300 watts without trouble.  The unit is quiet especially compared to trainers I previously owned.  My one gripe with the unit is that as the fluid heats up during longer or harder workouts it seems to get more viscous.  I am able to quantify this with a power meter.  This means you may need to shift down a gear or two over time.  Whether you buy this trainer or another you will want to make sure you have a way to raise the front wheel so the bike is level once it's in the trainer.  I have nearly 2000 miles on the rear tire on my normal "trainer" bike and there is no noticeable wear.  I had been concerned about the potential for excessive tire wear and I'm happy to see none.,One
Excellent trainer,5,David C. Feliciano,March/19/2014,Style:Trainer,否,I got this as a gift and I'm thrilled with it. First things first it's a trainer its going to be boring you can't compare that to an outdoor ride. That being said the resistance is excellent. Using this during the weekdays has made me a better cyclist faster than when I was just training outdoors. It's definitely helped me get stronger. Great for interval training. If you're going to have more than one rider I'd suggest purchasing an extra skewer to save you the hassle of going back and forth with the one included.,2
Exactly what I was hoping for; hard to assemble imo,4,Ilya N.,March/17/2017,Style:Trainer,否,This trainer was exactly what I wanted for training during the rainy season! This lets me ride while indoors and continue to stay in biking shape.Putting it together was a bit frustrating. There were two or three steps that watching the video you'd think would be super easy and the part would go right in but I had to break out the hammer to really get them to go where they were supposed to. Fortunately that was only a one-time thing!Obviously this doesn't come with whatever smart features but I could do without those. Noise level is quite manageable -- I can easily watch TV while biking and I'm not super worried about bugging the neighbors.,0

after few months of experience,4,YGal,April/4/2017,Style:Trainer,否,The old say - "It is not the product it is me".I purchased this unit few month ago convincing myself that summer is coming and while it is gonna be too hot I will use this trainer in my living room in front of the TV and do my exercise.Of course - I didn't - just a matter of laziness.Winter came and now I forced myself to use it - It was really great experience. Unit is working flawless and you find the right exercises (YouTube / cycleops) - you don't even feel how the time pass (I will admit - I never use it more than an hour - but I assume I could extend it to a longer time.I'm using the Garmin 705 on my bike with the full set of accessories  - so at the end of the practice I have a full statistic of the distance the speed  Cadence sensor and HR measurement.Unit is working great and I would give it 5 stars - but gave it only 4 as a result of :1. You have to be strong and really force yourself to ride at home - many of my friends bought it and almost never use it - so think twice before spending the money .2. Better to have it with rear wheel speedometer (Garmin Edge 705 - worked great for me) as it give you the right statistic and motivation3. Use it in front of big screen and picked the right show to watch - if not it is really boring4. Keep your old tires - better to use them and not your good one .And now when the spring come - hope to see the results riding outside  - Safe ride !!!,0

Not Ideal for 29-inch wheels,2,Jenn,December/29/2015,Style:Trainer,否,I tried this out on my Specialized Hardrock 29er and wound up returning it. While technically it fits the tire still rubs on the tile floor. And when you use this (or any other trainer) with a mountain bike - even with hybrid wheels - trainers are LOUD. I mean LOUD. Forget watching TV while on this. You would need high quality full-coverage headphones blasting heavy metal to counteract the noise. If that's your kind of biking then this trainer is perfect for you. Me? Not so much.,One

Very POOR Instructions,1,Amzn Cust Ace,January/3/2015,Style:Trainer,有,Assembly instructions poorly written - middle school student's could write much better instructions.  After spending this kind of money on a professional item it's not worth it to fight to figure out how to assemble the unit and install a bike to it.,2
Get the roller trainer instead and use the gears to adjust the resistance,2,Champ Tech,June/5/2017,Style:Trainer,否,Admitting I don't own one but I'm an old school cyclist who spent hundreds and hundreds of hours on the roller trainer and this trainer is more like for sissy cyclists (sorry if i's offending some of you). The roller trainers teach you how to ride in a straight line so it becomes as a second nature (of course after spending many many hours on the roller trainer). So now I can easily ride my bike on the roller trainer and not holding the handle bar and of course not keeping the trainer in the door way. Sure I don't keep it on the middle of the gym these days as we had to back than when I was on the pro team.,0
